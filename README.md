# C++ Graph project

A little project to respresent a network of nodes and edges as a graph. The graph builds the base for further works like network flow optimization. For that algorithms shall be implemented in the future.

To-Do:
[]GraphGenerator - create random valid graphs
[]GraphGenerator - write graph and adjacence matrix to file
[]GraphGenerator - read graph from file
[]Qt5 implementation to display the graph 
[]Shortest-path problems Optimization e.g. Dijsktra

Core builds into a static library and is meant to contain common code intended for use in multiple applications. App builds into an executable and links the Core static library, as well as provides an include path to Core's code.
